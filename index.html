        <h2>The Issue:</h2>
        <p>The UN has created 17 Sustainable Development Goals which are supposed to be achieved by 2030. The goal I’ve chosen is Good Health & Well-being.
            In Sweden, we’re lucky to have one of the best health-care systems in the world and are ranked among the top 10 happiest countries. (1) 
            Then, how are we still getting more stressed in our society? Especially, in the ages of 16-29 the number of people who admit to being too 
            stressed has increased.(2) One may argue that with the rise of social media, group pressure and the environmental crisis has caused this. Is this an issue then?
            For instance, in the UK, stress can be linked to the top 4 causes of death. Dementia, Heart Disease, Cancer and Diabetes. (3) Hence, how we then manage the 
            stress is very important. 
            My circle of concern is therefore my own and loved one’s well being. My circle of influence is to lead by example and live more sustainably. 
            As always, put the oxygen mask on yourself first before you tend to others.

    <div class="history">
        <h2>My history</h2>
        <p></p>September of 2018 changed my life. After one week of fainting and feeling as anything of annoyance would be the straw that broke the camel's back, 
            I went to the local health center. There, I got severe heart palpitations and got sent into the emergency room. After a couple of days I got diagnosed 
            with POTS (Postural Tachycardia Syndrome) and was put on medication with the only chance of getting better by following a training schedule. 
            It was due to a long history of chronic stress which was overbearing for the adrenal glands and other vital functions for the body.(4) 
            If not living correctly, POTS can show its true colours through extreme fatigue, heart palpitations, fainting and depression. 
            Therefore, a complete change of lifestyle was needed and a method was applied. </p>

    <div class="method">
        <h2>Method: Stress Management</h2>
        <p>It all comes down to one thing - habits. It is very simple in theory, but one needs to start out small. Think of yourself as a pot of soil and the 
            habit as a seed. If the seed which is put in the soil is taken care of, it'll begin to grow soon enough and in time, blossom. 
            On average, it takes about 66 days to create a habit. (5)
            However, if the body is supposed to have a chance to heal, management of both the physical and psychological elements is crucial.
