        <h2>The Issue:</h2>
        <p>The UN has created 17 Sustainable Development Goals which are supposed to be achieved by 2030. The goal I’ve chosen is Good Health & Well-being.
            In Sweden, we’re lucky to have one of the best health-care systems in the world and are ranked among the top 10 happiest countries. (1) 
            Then, how are we still getting more stressed in our society? Especially, in the ages of 16-29 the number of people who admit to being too 
            stressed has increased.(2) One may argue that with the rise of social media, group pressure and the environmental crisis has caused this. Is this an issue then?
            For instance, in the UK, stress can be linked to the top 4 causes of death. Dementia, Heart Disease, Cancer and Diabetes. (3) Hence, how we then manage the 
            stress is very important.<br> 
            My circle of concern is therefore my own and loved one’s well being. My circle of influence is to lead by example and live more sustainably. 
            As always, put the oxygen mask on yourself first before you tend to others.

    <div class="textContainer" id="history">
        <h2>My history:</h2>
        <p>September of 2018 changed my life. After one week of fainting and feeling as anything of annoyance would be the straw that broke the camel's back, 
            I went to the local health center. There, I got severe heart palpitations and got sent into the emergency room. After a couple of days I got diagnosed 
            with POTS (Postural Tachycardia Syndrome) and was put on medication with the only chance of getting better by following a training schedule. 
            It was due to a long history of chronic stress which was overbearing for the adrenal glands and other vital functions for the body.(4) 
            If not living correctly, POTS can show its true colours through extreme fatigue, heart palpitations, fainting and depression.<br> 
            Therefore, a complete change of lifestyle was needed and a method was applied. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="textContainer" id="method">
        <h2>Method: Stress Management</h2>
        <p>It all comes down to one thing - habits. It is very simple in theory, but one needs to start out small. Think of yourself as a pot of soil and the 
            habit as a seed. If the seed which is put in the soil is taken care of, it'll begin to grow soon enough and in time, blossom. 
            On average, it takes about 66 days to create a habit. (5)<br>
            However, if the body is supposed to have a chance to heal, management of both the physical and psychological elements is crucial.

    <div class="textContainer" id="physical">
        <h2>Physical:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I started drinking a healthy amount of water per day and cut out any alcohol and caffeine as it puts a lot of strain on the organs and nervous system.</li>
            <li>Went to sleep when I was tired and tried to get at least 8 hours of sleep per night.</li>
            <li>Started to eat more nutritious food and researched what I ate.</li>
            <li>Went to the gym, began with 15 min of workout 2-3 days/week and gradually increased the time and effort.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In conclusion, drink water, eat, sleep and move around.</p>

    <div class="textContainer" id="psychological">
        <h2>Psychological:</h2>
        <p>As stress comes from how our consciousness and unconsciousness handles life situations, it was very important to start acknowledging things. 
            Firstly, how I emotionally reacted to things. What made me tick, what made me happy, what made me sad. All emotions, negative or positive, 
            ignites several strong reactions in the body. Therefore, I couldn’t be “too sad” nor “too happy” or my body would fail me by either 
            hyperventilation or palpitations. After a while by acknowledging it, my consciousness knew where my train of thought was heading, 
            and in time I could cut it off before I reached the end destination. Where the emotions would be overbearing.<br>
            Secondly, I scheduled my days according to energy levels. For example, one day has a maximum of 10 energy points. Tasks would have different values, 
            cleaning would take 4 points, meeting up with a friend = 5 points and binge-watching a comedy series = 1 point. However, if I would go over the amount 
            of energy points I had, I knew it was going to have direct consequences. Therefore, setting up boundaries and planning less than what I was capable of 
            gave my body a chance to replenish itself.<br>
            Lastly, time management. I noticed one of my causes of stress was being too time optimistic. I rarely had any margins and would very often find myself 
            late to appointments, gatherings or meeting deadlines. Hence, adding a 20 min margin before and after an appointment to get to the next one lowered 
            the stress levels a lot. It wasn’t the only outcome, as friends and family noticed it as well and welcomed the change.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="textContainer" id="result">
        <h2>Results:</h2>
        <p>As a result, after one month of following the method I was able to cut 2/3 of the medication and 8 months in, no medication was needed at all. 
            Whilst I’m still recovering, I haven’t felt this well in my life. Due to taking one step at a time in making lifestyle changes, several of 
            my closest friends have started to take action as well. Not by me telling them what to do, but by actions and them noticing how I feel as a result. 
            Even people in general treat me differently, as I feel different now. In the end, what you are is what you exude. I began the journey thinking I 
            would only change myself, however others tended to change around me along the way. In summary, that’s how I’ve had an impact on this Sustainable Development Goal.</p>
